1. Open your terminal and go to your Craft project:

        cd /path/to/project

2. Then tell Composer to load the plugin:

        composer require wbrowar/craft-grid

3. In the Control Panel, go to Settings ‚Üí Plugins and click the ‚ÄúInstall‚Äù button for Grid.

## Grid Overview

Grid is a field that lets content editors lay out content connected through matrix and other relation fields (entries, assets, etc...).

![Adding field layouts](resources/img/demo-field-settings.png)

Grid‚Äòs settings let you define CSS grid rules for different layout breakpoints.

![Laying out content](resources/img/demo-field-input.png)

Content editors can optimize content layout for different screen sizes.

[Flexible Twig tags](https://github.com/wbrowar/craft-grid#adding-grid-to-a-twig-template) create the grid container and wraps all of the grid items while generating the CSS for each layout.

## Configuring Grid

### Target Field

Grid fields must be paired up with an element-based field to work. In Grid, this is called the "target field".

When setting up a Grid field a drop down field selects the target field from a list of supported field types, so it is best to create the target field before creating a Grid field.

*Once a Grid field is used and there is data stored in the CMS, it‚Äòs important that the target field is not changed. Changing the target field will result in lost or corrupt Grid data.*

### Supported Field Types

- Assets
- Categories
- Entries
- Matrix
- Users

### Field Settings

#### Layouts

Grid‚Äòs CSS code is generated mobile first, so the first grid layout is meant for mobile devices or it can used without any other breakpoints. To create additional grid layouts, create a breakpoint at the bottom of the page.

When adding a layout, the breakpoint‚Äòs `min-width` value is required. This is set as a number in pixel units. Grid layouts are sorted from smallest to largest breakpoint `min-width` value.

#### Columns and Rows

Columns and rows can be configured to a fixed layout or they can give editors the ability to add or remove columns and rows as needed. When you change the mode of a column or row, you‚Äòll see the fields that define the grid will change.

<img src="resources/img/column-row-mode.png" width="300">

##### Auto Mode

Setting a Row Mode to `auto` is like defining a CSS [`grid-auto-rows`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/grid-auto-rows) property. Content editors will be able to create as many rows as needed and the layout will follow the value you place in the Grid Auto Rows field.

Any valid `grid-auto-rows` value can be used in the Grid Auto Rows field. Mozilla offers some great examples on their web docs page: [MDN grid-auto-rows](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/grid-auto-rows#Syntax)

*NOTE: Column Mode works the same way, and example values can be found here: [MDN grid-auto-columns](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/grid-auto-columns#Syntax)*

##### Fixed Mode

When you want to define the exact column layout, setting Column Mode to `fixed` will let you define each column, just like [`grid-template-columns`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/grid-template-columns) would. For each column, enter in a valid size and you will see the grid preview reflect the amount of columns you have defined.

You can use valid sizing units‚Äîsuch as `fr`, `px`, `%`, `em`, or `rem`‚Äîand you can even use functions‚Äîlike `minmax()`‚Äîor keyword value‚Äîlike `max-content`. However, **values that create multiple columns‚Äîlike the `repeat()` function‚Äîshould not be used in `fixed` mode** because they will not be interpreted by the Grid field.

*Row Mode works the same way for fixed row layouts.*

## Using the Grid Field

![Live Preview example of grid layout](resources/img/live-preview-med.png)

When a Grid field is added to an element‚Äîsuch as an entry‚Äîit will look for its target field and display all of the items that populate the target field. At first, the field shows information for the smallest layout and at the top of the field you will see an icon that lets you select other layouts.

To lay out a piece of content onto the grid, click on the title of the content to begin. Click on a cell in the grid to set the starting point in that cell, then click on another cell to set the ending point.

When a piece of content has been laid onto the grid, a check mark will appear next to the title.

*TIP: Because CSS Grid allows it, you can overlap items in your layout. The order of the items in the target field determines which items are in the front and which are in the back.*

### Adding Grid to a Twig Template

To render a grid field, drop this into your Twig template.

```twig
{% grid entry.gridHandle as gridItems %}
    {% for item in gridItems %}
        {% griditem %}
            {# use item.content.fieldHandle to render grid item content #}
        {% endgriditem %}
    {% endfor %}
{% endgrid %}
```

- The `grid` block requires that you pass in your grid field (`entry.gridHandle`). Grid will determine the element and target field associated with the Grid field, however this can also be set (see Advanced Options). The `grid` block creates an HTML element along with the appropriate classes.
- On the `grid` block, `gridItems` is a variable that‚Äòs name can be set to anything you‚Äòd like.
- `gridItems` represents all of the content in the target field‚Äîalong with data from the `grid` block. A `for` loop is used to access each grid item.
- The `griditem` block creates an HTML element with the right classes to make your layout work.
- The content for each `item` can be accessed through `{{ item.content.fieldHandle }}`. For example, if each `item.content` was an entry, `{{ item.content.title }}` would display the title field.
- Here's an example of a matrix field that is processed inside of the `griditem` block:

```twig
{% grid entry.grid as gridItems %}
    {% for item in gridItems %}
        {% griditem %}
            {% switch item.content.type.handle %}
                {% case 'text' %}
                    <p>{{ item.content.myText }}</p>
                {% case 'image' %}
                    <img src="{{ item.content.myImage.one().url }}" alt="{{ item.content.myImage.one().title }}">
            {% endswitch %}
        {% endgriditem %}
    {% endfor %}
{% endgrid %}
```

---

#### Advanced Twig Options
The `grid` block and `griditem` block accept more arguments and configuration when needed.

##### Target Array

To specify your target field or to use eager loading for your target field, add your target field and the keyword `using` be for your Grid field on the `grid` block:

```twig
{% grid entry.relatedEntries.with['featuredImage'].all() using entry.grid as gridItems %}
    {# ... #}
{% endgrid %}
```

In this example, `entry.relatedEntries` is specified and eager loading is used to get a `featuredImage` asset.

*NOTE: This must be in the form of an array, so it‚Äòs important that you use `.all()` when passing in element criteria.*

---

##### Modify the Grid Container

By default, the `grid` block is turned into a `<div>` tag with predefined classes on it. A configuration object can be passed in to modify the tag, add classes, and set custom attributes.

```twig
{% grid entry.grid as gridItems with { attributes:"id='my_grid'" classes:"my classes", element:"nav", } %}
    {# ... #}
{% endgrid %}
```

| Argument | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `attributes` | `''` | Add in any valid HTML attribute, `data-` attributes, Vue directives, etc... |
| `classes` | `''` | Adds classes into the element‚Äòs `class` attribute. This can by helpful for styling the grid container and its child items. |
| `element` | `'div'` | Change the element for more semantic HTML or for better accessibility. |
| `preview` | `false` | Setting this to `true` adds simple styling to let you preview your content in your grid layout. This is meant to be used for early development and may not work with content that is already styled. |

---

##### Modify Grid Items

The `griditem` block creates a `<div>` tag for each grid item. A configuration object can be passed in to modify the tag, add classes, and set custom attributes.

```twig
{% grid entry.grid as gridItems %}
    {% for item in gridItems %}
        {% griditem with { attributes:"@click='clickHandler'" classes:"my_grid__item", element:"a", } %}
            {# ... #}
        {% endgriditem %}
    {% endfor %}
{% endgrid %}
```

| Argument | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `attributes` | `''` | Add in any valid HTML attribute, `data-` attributes, Vue directives, etc... |
| `classes` | `''` | Adds classes into the element‚Äòs `class` attribute. |
| `element` | `'div'` | Change the element for more semantic HTML or for better accessibility. |

### Browser Support

CSS Grid actually started out as a [feature in Internet Explorer 10](https://caniuse.com/#feat=css-grid), however, since then an updated spec has emerged and gained support in modern browsers. While it is possible‚Äîand often easy‚Äîto support the IE spec, Grid only supports the modern, non-prefixed spec.

To ensure that the right CSS spec is available, all of the CSS generated by Grid is wrapped in an `@supports` query. CSS Feature Queries and CSS Custom Properties‚Äîwhich is what the query is validating‚Äîare not available on any version of IE.
